## 9. OPERATIONS NOTES - HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### 9.1 What This System Does
The Signature Security Specialist (SSS) is a complete digital platform that manages everything for a private security company. Think of it as one system that handles scheduling, payroll, client communication, and guard management - all in one place.

**The Big Picture:**
- **For Clients**: They can see their guards, schedule shifts, and communicate directly
- **For Guards**: They can find shifts, track their hours, and get paid automatically
- **For Management**: Complete visibility and control over all operations

### 9.2 Who Uses This System

**Management Team:**
- **Owner/Co-Owner**: Sees everything, controls everything, makes final decisions
- **Operations Director**: Oversees the big picture, approves promotions, monitors performance
- **Operations Manager**: Handles daily operations, approves guard requests, manages schedules
- **Dispatch**: The scheduling hub - assigns guards to shifts, handles emergencies
- **Secretary**: Administrative support, manages applications, handles paperwork

**Field Team:**
- **Supervisor**: Oversees guards on-site, checks performance, can work shifts too
- **Training Officer**: Runs training programs, tracks certifications, can work shifts too
- **Guard**: The frontline workers who do the actual security work

**External Users:**
- **Client**: The people who hire security services

### 9.3 Guard Ranks & How They Work
Guards have ranks that affect their pay and shift priority, but NOT their permissions:

- **OFC (Officer)**: Entry level, basic pay
- **CPL (Corporal)**: First promotion, better pay and priority
- **SGT (Sergeant)**: Mid-level, higher pay and priority
- **LT (Lieutenant)**: Senior level, premium pay and priority
- **CAP (Captain)**: Highest rank, maximum pay and priority
- **CMD (Commander)**: Executive field leadership, premium pay and priority
- **DPT CHF (Deputy Chief)**: Senior executive rank, premium pay and priority
- **ASST CHF (Assistant Chief)**: Co-owner rank, premium pay and priority
- **CHF (Chief)**: Owner rank, maximum pay and priority

**Important**: Ranks only affect pay and which shifts they see first. They don't change what they can access in the system.

### 9.4 How People Get Into the System

**New Applications:**
- **Guards, Supervisors, and Clients** can apply themselves through the website
- **Dispatch, Training Officers, Secretaries, and Management** are created by Operations only
- All applications go into "Pending" status until reviewed

**Application Review Process:**
1. Person applies online
2. They can log in to check their application status
3. Operations reviews and either approves or rejects
4. If approved, they get access to their role's features
5. If rejected, their account is locked but kept for records

**Onboarding (Getting Started):**
- **Guards**: Must complete at least one training type before they can see shifts
- **Clients**: Must set up their sites and posts before they can create shifts
- **Supervisors**: Must complete operational training before they can oversee shifts

### 9.5 How Shifts Work

**Creating Shifts (Client Side):**
Clients create shifts by filling out:
- Date and time
- Location (site and specific post)
- What type of security is needed
- How many guards needed
- Pay rate (within their contract limits)
- Special instructions

**Finding Shifts (Guard Side):**
- Guards see all available shifts that match their training
- Shifts are prioritized by:
  1. Client whitelist (if client specifically wants this guard)
  2. Guard rank (higher ranks see shifts first)
  3. Availability and location
- Guards can't see shifts from clients who have blacklisted them

**Claiming Shifts:**
- First-come, first-served system
- Guard clicks "Claim Shift" and is instantly assigned
- Once claimed, other guards can't take that shift
- Guards get full details about the shift once confirmed

**Multi-Guard Shifts:**
- Some shifts need multiple guards
- System shows "3/5 guards confirmed" progress
- Guards can see who else is working the same shift
- Lead Guard system: Clients can request specific guards to lead

### 9.6 Time Tracking & Hours

**Check-In System:**
- Guards must check in when they start work (GPS verified)
- Hourly check-ins during the shift
- Check out when they finish (GPS verified)
- If they miss check-ins, Dispatch gets alerted

**Hour Limits & Wellness:**
- **20 hours**: System reminds guards to take breaks
- **40 hours**: Hard limit - guards can't schedule more shifts
- **Exceptions**: If no other guards available, system can override
- **Overtime**: Automatic 1.5x pay after 40 hours

**Pay Calculation:**
- System automatically calculates pay based on verified hours
- Includes overtime and holiday pay
- Guards can see their earnings in real-time
- Payments are processed weekly/bi-weekly

### 9.7 Money & Contracts

**How Contracts Work:**
Each client has a contract with:
- Total budget amount
- Company's percentage (usually 7%)
- Guard pay range (e.g., $25-$39 per hour)
- What types of security they can request

**Budget Tracking:**
- System calculates how many hours the contract can cover
- Clients can see remaining budget
- If they go over budget, shifts become "unfunded" until Operations approves

**Pay Structure by Type:**
- **Standard Security**: $25-$29/hour, 7% company fee
- **Medical Security**: $30-$35/hour, 8% company fee
- **Event Security**: $35-$45/hour, 12% company fee
- **Tactical Security**: $40-$50/hour, 15% company fee

### 9.8 Performance & Recognition

**How Performance is Tracked:**
- **Star Ratings**: Clients rate guards 1-5 stars after each shift
- **Completion Rate**: How many shifts they claim vs. actually complete

**Recognition System:**
- **Badges**: Guards earn badges for achievements (50+ shifts, high ratings, etc.)
- **Leaderboards**: Top performers each month
- **Spotlight Profiles**: Best guards get featured profiles
- **Hall of Fame**: Archive of all monthly winners

**Rewards:**
- Top performers get priority on shift listings
- Performance-based pay increases
- Recognition badges and profiles
- Monthly "Guard of the Month" awards

### 9.9 Supervisor Spot Checks

**What Supervisors Do:**
- Check on guards during shifts to ensure they're doing their job
- Verify guards are present, in proper uniform, and performing duties
- Must do 3 spot checks per shift: beginning, middle, and end

**Spot Check Rules:**
- Supervisors must do 5 uniformed spot checks before they can do plain-clothed checks
- Each spot check pays $15 (total $45 per shift if all 3 completed)
- Supervisors can work regular guard shifts too, but can't spot check their own shifts

**Spot Check Reports:**
- Supervisors file reports after each check
- Reports confirm: guards present, proper uniform, doing their job
- If reports are missing, Operations gets flagged

### 9.10 Communication System
